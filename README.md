## Inspiration
From a very long time I was thinking of making a selfbalancing bot and in this hackathon I tried to make one.
## What it does
This bot can balance itself, no matter how the surface is and what the surface is
## How we built it
I had built it using the motor driver, Arduino and two dc motors.
## Challenges we ran into
The challenge I ran into was the PID tunning of the bot to make it stable.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
That I had built the bot in this limited amount of time and the bot can balance itself well without any jittering effect.


## Technology Stack:
  1) Arduino
  2) Motor driver (L298)
  3) Dc motors
